= Detective Doc Site

This directory contains the sources for the Detective Documentation site. The sources are compiled
into the `docs` folder using a tool called http://www.foundweekends.org/pamflet/[Pamflet].

Since Pamflet picks up all Markdown files, I made this readme an asciidoc file so that it would be
ignored by the Pamflet compiler.

== Installing Pamflet

To install pamflet on your computer:

1. Install http://www.foundweekends.org/conscript/setup.html[Conscript].
2. Invoke `cs foundweekends/pamflet` to install Pamflet.

== Running the docs in watch mode

To run the documentation compiler in watch mode, change your current directory to docs-src and
invoke:

```
$ pf .
```

Pamflet will start in watch mode and refresh itself each time you change the files.

== Compiling the docs

To compile the docs for GitHub pages, change your current directory to docs-src and invoke:

```
$ pf . ../docs
```

Then commit and push the changes that result from this command.
