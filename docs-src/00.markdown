# Kafka Detective

**Kafka Detective** is an application for doing end-to-end testing against streaming data
applications. Detective works by comparing the contents of two Kafka topics (potentially on
different Kafka clusters) and ensuring that the content from the "test topic", the topic that your
new, candidate version of your code outputs on, has equivalent content in the "reference topic", the
topic that your known-good production code outputs on.

This document describes how to use Kafka Detective to debug your streaming data applications, how to
extend Kafka Detective with extensions, and walks through some of the detailed architecture of
Detective.

In addition to this document, you may find it useful to browse the available ScalaDocs for Detective
on this site:

* [kafka-detective-daemon](scaladocs/kafka-detective-daemon)

We'll try our darndest to keep this document up to date as changes come to Detective, but we
encourage you to open a PR fixing any issues you find along the way.
